I built this project with a focus on the front-end along with simple/fast rendering for users. I utilized **Next.js** (a framework that supports pre-rendering and server side rendering), **Styled Components** and a **PostgresQL** server hosted on AWS. Additionally, I utilized **Prisma** ( an ORM ) to further visualize and manipulate the database. This was one of my favorite projects as it helped me discover the JAMstack( Javascript, API and Markup) framework, which essentially calls for a revitalization of static websites/static generation.
