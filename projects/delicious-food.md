I built this project to primarily focus on my backend skills in **Node.Js**. The project features use of numerous CRUD operations/routes, along with user authentication/login and Google Map's API. The purpose of this application is to be able to sign-up and add reviews/new restaurants to share in your local area. The front end of this project was rendered with the javascript templating engine **Pug**. I go more in depth on different rendering methodologies in the blog portion of my website.
