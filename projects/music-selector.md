I built this project with a focus on the front-end along with simple/fast rendering for users. I utilized **Next.Js** (a framework that supports pre-rendering and server side rendering), **Styled Components** and a **PostgresQL** server hosted on AWS. Additionally, I utilized **Prisma** ( an ORM ) to further visualize and manipulate the database.
