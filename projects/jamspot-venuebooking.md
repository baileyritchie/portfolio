This project was built with a **Python (Flask)** back-end. This project was interesting as it let me explore the differences between operating a Python vs. Javascript backend. The database used for this project was **Postgres**, and the **SQLAlchemy ORM** was used as the interface of the database. On the front end, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap was used to create the user interface, which was served by the server-side templating engine **Jinja**. The project features standard CRUD operations and provides a search query for artists and venues.
